# Hello, I'm Saeed Ansarinejad 👋

I am a passionate software engineer with a variety of programming skills. Here’s a bit of my journey in the world of software development:

## background

- 🎓 I started my programming journey in high school, where I first got my hands dirty with VB6.
- 🏫 During my university years, I explored the world of C# and .NET development. This was the beginning of my love affair with C#, and I have been honing my skills ever since.
- 🪶 Over the years, I have successfully developed high-performance and easy-to-use software and developed many Windows applications.

## Mobile and web development

- 📱 I expanded my horizons by getting involved in Android app development by using Java and Eclipse IDE. This was an interesting part where I developed native Android applications.
- 🌐 My journey didn't stop. I explored web development and gained hands-on experience with MVC web applications.
- 🚀 I finally discovered Dart and Flutter, and the magic of cross-platform app development. My passion for creating beautiful and effective mobile apps soared.

## Full stack transport

- 💼 Today, I proudly call myself a full-stack developer. My skills include both front-end and back-end technology.
- 🌟 I went back to my roots with C# and .NET, where I continue to build scalable and performant web applications.
